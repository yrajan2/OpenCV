My Projects while learning OpenCV for Image Processing
This Repository contains 2 projects.
1. Drawing App: After running the app, you can draw on the canvas using your mouse. Press the 'b' key on the keyboard to increase the level of blue in the color of your drawing. Same for 'g' and 'r' for green and red.
2. Contours: This was an attempt to identify the contours present in the fuzzy image and draw the major ones.
